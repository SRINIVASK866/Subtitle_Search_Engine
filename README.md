# Subtitle_Search_Engine
The subtitle based search engine leverages pre-trained sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to understand subtitle meaning. Text preprocessing and efficient encoding enable semantic search, allowing users to find subtitles based on concepts, not just keywords. It utilizes database indexing for fast retrieval.
